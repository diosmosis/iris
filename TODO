- focus crap
- allow khaos::window in nyx::window to be swapped out
- put some sort of event compositioning in khaos (i.e. double click for x11, dragging, etc.)
    l_button_down >> l_button_up >> l_button_down
    l_button_down >> +mouse_motion
- put idle event in
- put a way for controls to affect padding.  i.e. padding for buttons may be different than w/ other stuff
- classify different event types (i.e. paint propagates downwards, while mouse_move propagates upwards until handled)
- font drawing/layout functions do not handle '\n', '\r' or tabs
- font drawing/layout does not do any word wrapping
- nyx::reposition_layout will change the padding, it should not
- grammar_list && grammar_count have much in common, so generalize

PROBLEMS:
    - use of GIL, means many platform specific functions dealing w/ images cannot be used (i.e. pretty much every function having to do w/ images in windows can't be used w/o copying the image first).  though since GIL is only used w/ regard to painting, this may not be a problem at all.
    - not having tons of classes for widgets simplifies things, but having to keep track of all the references does not i.e.:
        bool v = true;
        nyx::window cb = checkbox(v);
      this is much simpler than having a separate sub-API (so-to-speak) revolving around a checkbox class, BUT the user must now manage v
